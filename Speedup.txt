If you want to speed up the sd card reading, then you could use the libogc available here:
http://code.google.com/p/snes9x-gx/downloads/list
it uses a read ahead cache.

Just rename the libogc folder in your DevKitPro folder and place this libogc there.
If you want to use the regular libogc again, then you only have to switch both folders.
